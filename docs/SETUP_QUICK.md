# Setting up a development environment

It is recommended that you feel comfortable in whichever operating system you use for development. For example, bot runs on Ubuntu in production; Professor L develops on Ubuntu as well, but dexfore does so on MacOS, and Xael on Windows with [WSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10). Whichever you choose to use, it is expected that you know how to work with the command line at a basic level.

The first step is installing the necessary dependencies. For a quick setup, the only dependencies you need are python 3.8, pip3, sqlite, and redis. On Ubuntu, the installation looks like this:

```bash
sudo apt install python3.8 python3-dev python3-pip sqlite3 libsqlite3-dev redis-server
```

On other \*nix distributions, replace `apt` with your package manager (`dnf`, `yum`, `pacman`, `brew`, or something else).

Once those are installed, click the "Fork" button in the top right of this page to make your own copy of the `classic-tetris-project` repository. Then, you can head into your shell and clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/classic-tetris-project
cd classic-tetris-project
```

Replacing "YOUR-USERNAME" with your actual GitHub username.

Once you're in the project directory, you can install project requirements and set up the database:

```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
python3 manage.py migrate
```

Next, create your bot's accounts. For Discord, head to their [developer portal](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications) and click "New Application" in the top right. Once it's been created, head to the "bot" tab on the left and create a bot. Then, you'll be able to find the **token**. Additionally, make sure you have a Discord server in which you can test that bot (you need to have admin privs in a server to add a bot; I recommend creating a new server). Take note of that server's [ID](https://support.discordapp.com/hc/en-us/articles/206346498-Where-can-I-find-my-User-Server-Message-ID-), too; you'll need it, along with the token, for later.

For Twitch, create a standard Twitch account (different from your everyday account - I recommend doing this in either another browser or in private/incognito mode), then head to `https://twitchapps.com/tmi/`. TMI stands for "Twitch Messaging Interface", and that page will help you generate an **oauth key**, which you will need.

Finally, it's time to set up a `.env` file. This is the basic structure for that:

```
DISCORD_TOKEN=your_bots_discord_token
DISCORD_GUILD_ID=your_discord_guild_id

TWITCH_USERNAME=your_bots_twitch_username
TWITCH_TOKEN=your_twitch_oauth_key

TWITCH_CLIENT_ID=<ask me for this>
```

Once you have that in place (To be clear, it should be saved in a file called `.env` in the project's root directory), you can start up the bot:

```
python3 manage.py bot
```

To see if everything's working, the `!test` command should result in the bot enthusiastically responding with "Test!". (NOTE: on Twitch, do **not** attempt to invoke commands from the bot's account. Log into your normal Twitch account to test the bot.)  If you're getting errors, review the steps above.

From here, most commands should work, but some (like !profile) require the web portion of the bot to be set up, which you can do by following [SETUP_WEB.md](SETUP_WEB.md).
